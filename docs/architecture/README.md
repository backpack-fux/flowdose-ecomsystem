# Architecture Documentation

This document provides an overview of the Flowdose Ecomsystem architecture.

## System Architecture

The Flowdose Ecomsystem is a modern e-commerce platform built using a microservices architecture. The system consists of the following major components:

### Core Components

1. **Backend Service (Medusa.js)**
   - E-commerce business logic
   - REST API endpoints
   - Admin functionalities
   - Service integrations

2. **Storefront (Next.js)**
   - User-facing web application
   - Product browsing and search
   - Shopping cart and checkout
   - Account management

3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - Primary data store
   - Stores product, customer, and order data
   - Handles transactional data

4. **Cache Layer (Redis)**
   - Session management
   - Caching for improved performance
   - Pub/sub for real-time features

5. **Search Engine (MeiliSearch)**
   - Fast, typo-tolerant search capabilities
   - Product indexing and search
   - Faceted search capabilities

6. **File Storage (MinIO/DO Spaces)**
   - Product images and assets
   - Secure file storage
   - CDN integration for fast delivery

## Data Flow

The data flows through the system as follows:

1. User interacts with the Storefront (Next.js)
2. Storefront makes API calls to the Backend (Medusa.js)
3. Backend processes business logic
4. Backend interacts with PostgreSQL for data persistence
5. Backend uses Redis for caching and session management
6. Backend uses MeiliSearch for search functionality
7. Backend uses MinIO for file storage

## API Architecture

The API follows REST principles with these main endpoints:

- `/products` - Product management
- `/customers` - Customer management
- `/orders` - Order management
- `/carts` - Cart management
- `/admin` - Admin functionalities

## Security Architecture

The security architecture includes:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
3. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **API Security**: Rate limiting and input validation

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture is designed for scalability:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Services can be scaled horizontally
2. **Vertical Scaling**: Services can be allocated more resources
3. **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL can be scaled through managed services
4. **Caching**: Redis caching reduces database load

## Deployment Architecture

See the [Deployment Documentation](../deployment/README.md) for details on how the system is deployed.

## Development Architecture

The development architecture follows these principles:

1. **Monorepo Structure**: All services are in a single Git repository
2. **Service Isolation**: Each service has its own directory
3. **Shared Configurations**: Common configurations are shared
4. **Local Development**: Services can be run locally for development

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Kubernetes Migration**: For more advanced scaling and management
2. **Service Mesh**: For improved service-to-service communication
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: For better decoupling of services
4. **GraphQL API**: For more flexible API queries
